I'm interested in designing performant and delightful software. I love open-source and have contributed a bunch. *I'm looking for Summer 2025 internships. If you find what I've done cool, I'd love to work with you.* Feel free to [contact me](mailto:sendtokartavya@gmail.com) if you'd like to chat about something I've worked on or might find interesting.

### Work
I previously worked on icu4x, an official i18n library by the Unicode consortium, and Librarian, a bioinformatics quality control tool.

### Research
I'm broadly interested in programming languages, distributed systems and operating systems. My current work is in creating optimizations for [Mergeable Replicated Datatypes](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/suresh/papers/oopsla19-mrdt.pdf).

### A chronological ordering of stuff I've done / am doing
#### Fall 2024
- ongoing: an eBPF packet filter to drop packets based typing speed with a video codec written from scratch to showcase said packet loss. For Purdue Hacker's [BURST](https://burst.purduehackers.com/).
- [filed a bug report for the Linux kernel's memory management subsystem](https://marc.info/?t=172402767200002&r=1&w=2)
- employed as a Research Assistant working with [Prof. Suresh Jagannathan](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/suresh/) working on optimizing MRDTs.
- employed as a Teaching Assistant for Data Structures.
- employed as a developer teaching assistant for Programming in C. I created test modules for course assignments.
- went to the [Midwest Programming Languages Summit](https://pl.cs.uchicago.edu/PLSummit/2024/) at UChicago and met many interesting people!

- (Relevant) classes:
  - Programming Languages. Assignments included:
    - writing lots of interpreters in OCaml. (I enjoyed all of them)
    - verifying simple programs in Dafny
  - Systems Programming. Assigments included:
    - a malloc implementation. I made mine robust enough to run Chrome.
    - writing a shell with pipes, quoting, subshells, stream redirection (in C)
    - HTTP/1.1 web server with authorization, cgi-bin modules and dynamic module loading (in C)
    - (team project) a graphical system monitor (Ã  la `top`). (in C++ and ImGui)
  - Analysis of Algorithms. Assignments included:
    - proving the correctness of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms.
    - proving the NP-completeness of many problems
  - Independent Study in Embedded Systems with [Prof. Douglas Comer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Comer), TCP/IP legend.
    - designed audio streaming system with PulseAudio to Raspberry Pis for concurrent audio playback.
    - wrote an [RTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_Transport_Protocol)-like protocol for streaming audio over UDP

#### Summer 2025
- Google Summer of Code contributor for [icu4x](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu4x). Mentored by Younies Mehmoud from Google; almost all my coworkers ended up being Google employees. [Final report here.](https://gist.github.com/kartva/ff139f31876a42a0934ef84755596b2e)
- Summer Undergraduate Research Fellow at Purdue University studying [Mergeable Replicated Datatypes](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/suresh/papers/oopsla19-mrdt.pdf) using [Irmin](https://irmin.org/) and OCaml.

### Spring 2024
- I wrote [a clean inter-process communication program using POSIX shared memory](https://github.com/kartva/memtalk)
- I participated in the [Open Source Contributor Initiative by OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/blog/Receive-mentorship-from-Amazon-engineers-and-accelerate-your-career-in-Tech/) and worked on the Performance Analyzer component in OpenSearch using Java.
- (Relevant) classes:
  - Competitive Programming 2. Topics included segment trees, hashing, tries, graph algorithms, and combinatorics.
  - Computer Architecture
    - I wrote a just-in-time compiler in Rust for ARMv8 assembly as part of an honors contract (extra work done in exchange for honors credit).
  - Data Structures
  - Linear Algebra

### Fall 2023
- (Relevant) classes:
  - Programming in C
  - Foundations of Computer Science / Discrete Math
  - Honors Multivariable Calculus
  - Independent study in the C++11 memory model with [Prof. Suresh Jagannathan](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/suresh/). I explored tactics for designing performant and correct lock-free algorithms.
 
### Before University
- I started working on Librarian with the Babraham Bioinformatics Institute in 2020. My work on Librarian was [published here](https://f1000research.com/articles/11-1122/v2) first in 2022, and then the revision in 2024.
- I briefly worked with [Trestle Labs](https://www.trestlelabs.com/) on computer vision using OpenCV in winter 2023.

My [blog](https://desmondwillowbrook.github.io/blog/) - it's not completely up to date.
